- Card is placed in the middle to start, Cannot be a power card
- Play starts from the left
- Legal cards played need to match the suit or the number of the middle card

- Can play multiple of the same card number + suit in one turn
- When a player has only one remaining card they must call it or be penalised

[Power card rules (Irish switch modified)]

- 2 the next player is required to pick up two cards. These effects may stack.
- 7: a player may skip a turn once the other player puts down at 7 of any suit, the next player can place another 7 down to make the next player skip, multiple people can put a 7 down, this action happens until no one has a 7, making them skip their turn.
- Jack: a Jack is used in play so the player can reverse to the previous player, one player may put down multiple jacks at the same time, if there are only two players in the game one player will put a jack down, making it reverse to themself, they can then put another card down on top of it.
- King of Hearts: Requires a player to pick up five cards, unless they have the 2 of hearts which allows the 2 chain to start if the next player has another 2
- Ace: Can be placed on any card of the same suit, and change the suit to any.
- Ace of spades: Same effect as the ace but you get to pick one of 3-1 random cards that have already been played
